 welcome.1.d:0 "In the year 1924, the world lies frozen beneath the grip of an eternal winter, unleashed by the catastrophic aftermath of the Great War. Nations have crumbled, and survival is a daily struggle in this diesel-fueled wasteland. The journey is treacherous, and only the strongest will endure the biting cold and endless dangers that lie ahead. As the winds howl and the frost creeps closer, you must make your way through the cold, where survival is earned through grit, determination, and the will to fight for a future beyond the ice.\n\nWelcome to Post Frigidus Early Access.
