 THE_RAGING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is 1924, two years after Germany launched their superweapon, “Eternal Winter,” designed to end the Great War. The blizzard it caused rages on with no end in sight. Temperatures dropping every day as all nations are struggling to hold themselves together. Citizens across the globe flock to population centers in dire hope of scraping together enough to survive the Freeze."

 RTX_RAGING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the frozen aftermath of the Great War, the once-vibrant lands of Texas are now a cold and desolate frontier. Isolated and diminished, the Republic of Texas has become a bastion of survival under the iron-fisted rule of President Samuel Colton. Guided by military might and industrial ingenuity, the nation stands fortified against a world plunged into chaos. With the Eternal Winter biting at its very core and hostile forces looming from Mexico, Texas clings to its independence. The people look to their leaders—the battle-hardened President and his Supreme General—for strength as they face an unforgiving world."
