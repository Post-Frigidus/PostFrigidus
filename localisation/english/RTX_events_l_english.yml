  RTX.2.t:0 "Chapter 1 - Restoration"
  RTX.2.d:0 "The once beautiful expanse of Texas is now in ruins after the Great Freeze. Much of the land fell, abandoned and lawless. What remains are a couple of dangerous survivalist factions and the disorganized nation state of Texas, which lost Trans-Pecos and the Rio Grande Brushlands to Mexico. It is your responsibility to restore Texas and push it forward to greatness.\n\n§RGAMEPLAY INFORMATION§!\nThis nation is extremely story-driven and lore heavy. The focus tree for Texas is set up in chapters and subchapters. It is meant to play out like a story line. It is not linear, there are plenty of paths for you to take, however the only way to progress to the next chapter is to complete certain criteria, such as completing a focus subtree. Opening a new chapter will not lock you out of focuses in previous chapters, with very few exceptions. If opening a new chapter will lock you out of a focus, you will be notified in the focus popup."
  RTX.2.a:0 "An arduous task, indeed."
